This program follows the acceptance criteria that was set in the beginning.
Only three inputs are accepted
  - the first two inputs have to be numbers.
  - the last input must be specified as a operator.

The program has a class that converts the inputs into an accepted format, the double data type has been to accomidate the decimal values from using division. 

The program prevents a crash by using the try and catch techniques.

Too mkae this project better I could log the common Exceptions
